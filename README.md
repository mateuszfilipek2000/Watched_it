# Disclaimer
This is my first flutter app, so it probably contains a lot of bad approach examples and therefore should not be used for learning purposes!
I do not own any images / videos / data visible in this app, they're provided by TMDB API - this app is built around it, but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB in any way.
This whole app was made for learning purposes, so please be understanding.
